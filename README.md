# diceGame
I have 2 die, 6 sided each I start the game and print the intro  “Hey! Welcome to Tina’s Dice Game.” “Let’s start!” The computer randomly generates what side of the die is chosen (for each die) I then add both of the random numbers together  I then print  Dice 1 = (the random number I got)  Dice 2 = (the random number I got) Depending on what number I get, something different is printed to the screen If I get an even number  I print “I got (value of dice 1) and (value of dice 2)!”  I print “Evens are better than odds!” If I get an odd number I print “I got (value of dice 1) and (value of dice 2)!”  I print “Odds are still cool!” At the end, I ask the user if they want to play again If the answer is “YES”  I “throw” the die again and repeat the printing process If the answer is anything but YES (case-sensitive) I end the game and print the outro  “The number of times the dice was thrown is: (value of times dice is thrown)” “Nice game!” “Thanks for playing, Come play again soon!”
